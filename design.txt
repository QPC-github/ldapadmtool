The objective of this tool set is to provide a complete set of account management tools that are somewhat portable across subdomains, so that one command can be used across multiple domains.


LDAP user administration tools - this module addresses all aspects of creating users, modifying them, adding them to groups or netgroups, and even keeping netgroups aligned with Outlook mail groups.

LDAP host administration - this module manages properly configuring hosts to be LDAP clients,
performing consistency checks on hosts including nightly audits, distributing and instslling software or data files, and monitoring.

LDAP netgroup management functions will be accessed by both of the above tools.
Also needed will be automount and sudo LDAP management tools.

the following ldap object classes have been implemented as equivalent modules:
user
gidgroup
netgroup
host
automount
sudoer

other custom classes:
ldapconnection


In general my use of getopts will be to use lower case letters for switches that include
arguements, and upper case letters for standalone switches.

The main file is ldapadmtool.pl, which attempts to limit its own role to providing help,
argument parsing, and divvying out tasks to the other included modules. Each module
implements its own entry point function, which will be named ldapadmtool<module>Main(),
for example ldapadmtoolUserMain resides in user.pm.

A few actions are basically "combo actions" comprised of one or more atomic actions. 
Combo actions include things like "create a user and add him to a netgroup". Often,
these actions will involve multiple objects (user and netgroup, for example), and 
may throw exceptions or make choices mid-way. Most combo actions will be controlled 
from the main ldapadmtool.pl module.
